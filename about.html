      <h4>	I was born in China and immigrated to United States when I was 11 years old.
	My first year here was tough because I couldn't speak or understand English,
	but as time goes on, I made new friends here and my English also got better. Most of my family members are in China. I have zero siblings but I have a 
	lot of cousins. All my cousins are guys and they all older than me.

    </div>I studied in China until I was 11 years old and currently I am a 15 years old sophomore 
      who is attending school at Rowland High School. I am taking 7 classes this year 
      including World history honor, Spanish 2, Ap Computer Science, Chemistry, 
      Pre-Calc, English 10 honor, and Swimming. The hardest class I have is English. 
      I hope I'll do well in English. My goal for the school year is to get good grades, 
      hopefully straight A's. <span class="w3-tag w3-light-grey">

	  </p>One of my favorite sports is swimming. I started swimming when I was 9 years old. 
	    after I moved to here I continued to swim. <img src="images/9 swim.JPG"class="w3-round w3-image w3-opacity-none" alt="Menu" width="300" height="300" align="bottom"> </h4> I swam 2 years in China and then I swim in both club and high 

	    school.<align="left">I love swimming because it is fun. It is a great way to make friends and it doesnâ€™t feel like exercise when I 
am swimming with friends. I also joined water polo this year, water polo is hard but it is a also a super fun sport.
